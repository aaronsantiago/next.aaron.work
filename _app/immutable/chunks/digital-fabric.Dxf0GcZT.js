Sensors, screens, and software all have quirks that are ironed out and flattened when distilled into consumer electronics.</em> digital fabric <em>is a project that summons these quirks and frames them, creating spectacle out of the personalities of electronic components. When the color range of camera sensors meets the color reproduction of screens, chaos ensues, elongated and modulated by the fluctuating latency of the software driving the feedback. The resulting images are an ebb and flow of light and color, sparked by initial conditions and driven by the character of the technologies combined with physical variables such as sensor alignment and ambient light.</em></p>',1);function l(e){var a=s();t(10),i(e,a)}export{l as default,d as metadata};
