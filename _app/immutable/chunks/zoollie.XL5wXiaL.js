Using custom built physics and Niantic Lightship’s real-time meshing, you can skate everywhere. Place down ramps or funboxes to get some extra height, and build real-world obstacles and parks with whatever you have lying around. In case you really need to gap something massive, every skater comes equipped with a ROCKET BOOSTER! Cobra can’t push very well anyway…</strong></p> <p><a href="https://vimeo.com/668068898" rel="nofollow">Submission Video</a></p> <p>Technologies used: Unity, Niantic Lightship, Adobe Premiere.</p>`,1);function m(e){var a=s();o(8),t(e,a)}export{m as default,p as metadata};
