DUET is a movement ritual for virtual reality made in collaboration with Brandon Powers.

Other team members include Michael Fewkes, Nate Turley, Viji Rajaratnam, Lara Bucarey, Jono Hill and Jon Hansen.

DUET merges real-life performance with VR experience design, bringing two participants into a proscenium space and guiding them to move together with game-like visual elements.
DUET was designed meticulously with its participants in mind, including guiding choreography for introducing them to the headsets and the experience.
