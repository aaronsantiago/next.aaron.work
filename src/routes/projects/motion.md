_The motion series takes an alternative approach to game design that involves designing systems over levels. Inspired by skilltoys and musical instruments, pieces in the series present all of their mechanics to the player up-front. "Progression" comes in the form of the discovery of nuance during interaction, providing rewards in the form of learned skills or new experiences._
