A free and open-source tool for creating online immersive experiences through the web. Created in collaboration with the Columbia Digital Storytelling Lab.

Simple Stage Manager uses peer-to-peer networking to create a free system for controlling audience browser tabs remotely and collaboratively. Stagehands and performers can trigger effects on audience screens that happen simultaneously and seamlessly, such as webpage overlays, YouTube audio and video, and fades.
