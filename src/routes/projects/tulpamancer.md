*Tulpamancer, created by Marc Da Costa and Matthew Niederhauser uses open-source AI tools, including Open AI and StableDiffusion, to reconstruct users’ memories and dreams in a guided two-step journey, then reproduce through virtual reality (VR).*

*In the trailer of Tulpamancer, we hear the voice of ‘Tulpa’, a software program that, according to the story of the piece, was discovered in an old warehouse that once housed the laboratory of an East German scientist.*
