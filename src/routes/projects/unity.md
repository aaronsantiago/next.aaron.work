In partnership with the Queens Public Library, I led a series of four Unity workshops.
<!--more-->
These workshops were focused on enabling people of any skill level, including those new to creative software.
To that end, these workshops did not include any programming lessons, and instead showed how to create expressive work using free assets available online.

All four sessions can be found on [YouTube here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdw4e33j9vNMEIBeQUqPhBOD0ab0IKfiU ).
