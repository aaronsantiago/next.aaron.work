An app created for the Niantic Lightship Winter Challenge.

<!--more-->

ZoOllie uses Niantic Lightship to mesh environments in real time. The resulting mesh is used as a skateable surface.
In-game objects are also available to place to enable dynamic and creative lines.

__Mix real-life objects with skate-park classics and ride your environment with cute zoo animals and rocket boosters!
Using custom built physics and Niantic Lightship's real-time meshing, you can skate everywhere. Place down ramps or funboxes to get some extra height, and build real-world obstacles and parks with whatever you have lying around. In case you really need to gap something massive, every skater comes equipped with a ROCKET BOOSTER! Cobra can't push very well anyway...__
