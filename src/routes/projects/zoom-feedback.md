An interactive zoom session I led at ITP Camp 2020.
<!--more-->
Using the annotation tools in Zoom and routing a screenshare through TouchDesigner, participants could interact with evolving visuals with the drawing and annotation tools.
Participants were also encouraged to use their bodies to draw on the canvas by convincing the Zoom algorithm to place their picture in the preview.

Technologies used: TouchDesigner, OBS, Zoom
